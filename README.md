This is my personal code library where I compiled **all tropic part by part** the important templates that you will need in CP. Most of the codes are originally written by me and some of them are collected from others but modified in a cleaner way.



It took me around 3 years to complete the list and can change the list regularly with new data structures and algorithms. Maybe each line is just a line to you but to me it tells a story of the excitements I had while learning those stuffs, the sleepless but fun nights I had to seek knowledge. 

#### Why am I sharing this library?

- By sharing your code library, you can collaborate with other programmers who are interested in competitive programming. They can provide feedback, suggest improvements, or even contribute their own additions to the library. Collaboration can foster learning, enhance the quality of the code, and help you discover new techniques or approaches.

- Sharing your code library can lead to valuable learning opportunities. When others review your code and provide feedback, you can gain insights into alternative solutions, optimization techniques, or better programming practices. It's an opportunity for mutual learning and growth.



Also, you can make me happy(as in to pay me) just by giving a star to the repository.
